Implement tests for DZ stats

PDP deals with sigma & KDE deals with bandwidth
    Refactor variables appropriately

Force user to input 2 sigma data... or else

Fix the navbar (disappears instead of getting smaller)
    change it to have a 3-line thing and a drop-down menu when it gets too small
    make it just show DZtools and the favicon
