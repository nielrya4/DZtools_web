Applications:
    In dzMix, implement kuiper and KS tests instead of just r^2. Search for quicker, more optimized functions for r^2, kde generation, and cdf generation.
    MDS: Make options for R^2, ks, kuiper, likeness, (already have similarity)

Infrastructure:
    finish matrices classes
    fully implement HTMX to lessen the amount of times the page needs reloaded

New Interface:
    Add a section where samples can be uploaded.
        Optional: Loaded samples vs active samples boxes

Long Term:
    Add users and login (maybe google accounts?)
