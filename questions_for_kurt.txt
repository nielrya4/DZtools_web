Should MDS plot have lines? How should the colors be?
    Yes, have lines. Think about colors.

Should Relative Contribution Plots use sample names or sample numbers?

How do I actually do the Monte Carlo Model?
    Randomly select percent contributions of each source/sample
Are we only working with ages, or should I code in other attributes to samples and grains?
